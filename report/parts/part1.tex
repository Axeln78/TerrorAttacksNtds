\label{sec:Introduction}
Analysing terror organisations and predicting terror attacks is a subject of interest for national security organisations. From data on  terrorist relationships and terror attacks, this project aims to assess whether terrorist relationships can be viewed as a social network, and to try to predict terror attacks locations from some known features. 

To help reaching these goals, graph theory and data analysis tools  provided by the course \textit{A Network Tour Of Data Science} at EPFL will be used.
