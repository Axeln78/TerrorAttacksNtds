\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
Section~\ref{subsec:terror attack quality} explains that the ``Terror Attacks" dataset contains flaws that make it difficult to analyze.

However, the results in Table~\ref{tab:Prediction accuracy for different node distance weightings} show that predicting the location of an attack with its features is feasible even though the prediction is not very efficient. This result suggests that there is a link between the location of an attack and its characteristics (such as the type of the attack).
