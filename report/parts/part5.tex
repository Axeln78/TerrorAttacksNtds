\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
Analysing the terrorist relationships graphs showed that the network does not correspond to a scale-free network, which is typical for social networks.

The prediction algorithm yields reasonable results, given the flaws contained in the data and the compromises that had to be made (removal of isolated nodes, selection of a lead node).
%Section~\ref{subsec:terror attack quality} explains that the ``Terror Attacks" dataset contains flaws that make it difficult to analyze.

%However, the results in Table~\ref{tab:Prediction accuracy for different node distance weightings} show that predicting the location of an attack with its features is feasible even though the prediction is not very efficient. This result suggests that there is a link between the location of an attack and its characteristics (such as the type of the attack).
