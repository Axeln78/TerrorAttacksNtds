Exploring the dataset ``Terror Attacks" led to formulating the following question: is it possible to predict the location of a terrorist attack given a list of features of this attack? 

The goal of this project is to answer this question using data analysis tools provided by the course ``\textit{A Network Tour Of Data Science}".
