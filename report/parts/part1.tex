\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}
Analysing terror organisations and predicting terror attacks is a subject of interest for national security organisations. From data on  terrorist relationships and terror attacks, this project aims to assess whether terrorist relationships can be viewed as a social network, and to try to predict terror attacks locations from some known features. 

To help reaching these goals, graph theory and data analysis tools are used, as part of the course \textit{A Network Tour of Data Science} at EPFL.
