The nodes of the network are relations between terrorists. These nodes are connected together if the relations share one individual.

The nodes of the network are terrorist attacks. These nodes are connected together if the attacks were located in places that are close.
Thus, the formation of the network implies a transitive relation between most of the nodes. Indeed, if for most nodes, take $a$ $b$ and $c$ in the network, we have

\begin{equation}
	a \sim b \text{ andÂ } b \sim c \text{ then } a \sim c 
\end{equation}

Equivalently, if attack $a$ took place close to $b$, and attack $b$ took place close to $c$, then it is probable that attack $a$ took place close to $c$.
