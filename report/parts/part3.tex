\section{Terrorist Relationships as a Social Network}
\label{sec:Terrorist Relationships as a Social Network}
In this section, the properties of the terrorist relationships line graph as a relational network is explored. As~\cite{ZSG2006} mentions, an organisation needs interpersonal connection to function and studying the structure of the social organisation could allow to predict the evolution of terrorist organisations.

\cite{krawczyk_line_2011}~found that on the basis of a study of an online social network, such a network could be well approximated by the line graph of a scale free network. Assuming that there exists a transitivity relation between nodes (see Equation~\ref{eq:transitivity}) as one would expect in a social network, a scale free network corresponding to the relationships graph has been generated. Its line graph counterpart has then been compared to the relationships graph (see Figure~\ref{fig:RelationshipScaleFree} below).
%If that propriety can be verified by our dataset, %then we could gain information from the original graph from which the line graph originates.
%
%Social sciences studies have shown that social/relationship networks have the particularities of homophily and transitivity.
%Logically if $a$ \& $b$ are friends and $c$\& $b$ are also, the it is more likely that $a$ \& $c$ are friends than not. This mathematically translates to:
%\begin{equation}
%	a \sim b \text{ andÂ } b \sim c \text{ then } a \sim c
%\end{equation}
%
%As a first research question we will try to verify that our dataset derives from a scale-free network, implying that the graph that generated the relationship dataset have proprieties similar to social networks.
%By creating a scale-free network and making its line graph, we compared the degree distribution of the relationship dataset we were able to show that.

From the degree distribution comparison, we can conclude that the terrorist relationships network shows no significant similarity with a  social network.
